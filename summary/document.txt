This is my implementation of Assignment 1 in COMPSYS726.
When I have finished, I feel it is quite interesting and challenging.

Totally, I spent:
5 hours on ROS platform tutorial and installation
2 hours on Lab experiment
1 hour on the shell script and github
8 hours on the first version which can control speed and keep balance
4 hours on designing and testing the trap escaper
1 hour on clean code and comments
